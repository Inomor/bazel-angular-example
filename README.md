## (Synthetic) Large Angular example

This is an extension of the Angular Bazel example published in rules_nodejs.

The main addition: a mechanism to generate extra Angular modules/components,
with which to demonstrate a large scale build.

Useful commands:

```bash
ng serve
```

```bash
ng serve --prod
```

```bash
yarn server-ssr
```
